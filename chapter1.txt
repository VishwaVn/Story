mkdir Story
cd Story
touch chapter1.txt 
start chapter1.txt
git init to create the repository
the chapter1.txt is not in the staging area, we need the staging area to keep track of the changes 
to see what is currently inside your staging area, you can use the git status command and it shows 
you the untracked file in red , this is something inside your working directory, but not yet in the staging 
area 
In order to add to the staging area and start tracking changes in it, we have to use the command 
git add chapter1.txt for instance , and use the git status and check the status again the colour of the file 
will be in green indicating it is on the staging area and it is ready to be commited 

Now we will commit the file using the command 
git commit -m "
where "m" is the commit message that helps us keep track of the what changes we have made in each commit
